XavierCS is a casual technology journal and devlog started by Xavier, a game engine developer with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Being casual, it means that articles consist of what the author wants to write about and his opinions without following any strict themes. Detailed benchmarks and hardware testing is not currently in the scope of the journal, however it is something being considered in the distant future.

Currently, and likely forever, the only author is Xavier. Currently, there is not any contact information listed here, however the plan is to create some kind of rotating email address that changes in order to combat bots. A contact form would be preferred, however since this site is hosted on GitHub Pages, it is a static site, and so all details of the form including any email addresses, would need to be stored here. This may change in the future if the site is hosted on a VPS.
